The current mirror is an analog circuit that senses the reference current and generates the copy or number of copies of the reference current, with the same characteristics. The replicated current is as stable as the reference current source. The replicated current could be the same as the reference current (Id = Iref),


The relation between the Id and Iref can be given by the following expression.

Id = ( (W/L)1 / (W/L)ref ) * Iref

By changing the W/L ratio of the two transistors, the current which is fraction or multiple of the reference current can be generated. The only thing which needs to be ensured is that, the MOSFET should operate in the saturation region.

#### Simulation 
#### 1) Current mirror circuit with 1:1 ratio
Design a current mirror circuit which has a gain of AV = -10V/V, power supply of Vdd = 1.8V, and power of P <= 1mW. Find reference current (Iref), output current (Id), and total current (Itotal). Perform DC and AC analysis for mirror ratio 1:1, 1:2. Vary length from 180nm -> 500nm -> 1Âµm and do the analysis.

##### Circuit Diagram
Itotal = ( Power / Vdd )
= ( 1m / 1.8 )
= 0.55mA

Iref = Id = ( Itotal / 2 )
= 0.55m / 2
= 0.277mA
