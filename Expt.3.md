**Differential Amplifier Using MOSFETs**  

**Aim:**  
To design and analyze a MOSFET-based differential amplifier by performing **DC analysis, transient analysis, and AC analysis** to understand its biasing, time-domain response, and frequency characteristics.
Design question: To Design a basic diffrential amplifier for the following specification Vdd=3.3V,P<=3mW,Vincm=1.72V,Vocm=1.8V,Vp=0.7V,Perform DC Analysis,Transient analysis,AC Analysis and extract the required parameters.


**Theory:**  
A **MOSFET differential amplifier** is a fundamental circuit used in analog electronics, particularly in operational amplifiers, signal processing, and communication circuits. It amplifies the voltage difference between two input signals while suppressing common-mode signals.

**Circuit Description:**  
A MOSFET differential amplifier consists of:  
1. **Two matched MOSFETs (M1 and M2)** forming the differential pair.  
2. **A current source (or resistor) at the source terminal** to provide a stable tail current.  
3. **Drain resistors (RD1 and RD2)** to convert current variations into voltage output.  
4. **Supply voltage (V_DD)** to power the circuit.  
5. **Gate terminals receiving the differential inputs (\(V_{in1}\) and \(V_{in2}\)).**

**Types of Analysis:**

**1. DC Analysis (Biasing and Operating Point Calculation):**  
DC analysis helps determine the operating point (Q-point) of the MOSFETs.  
- Assume both transistors are in **saturation region**:  

  I_{D} = 1/2 * Mu_n * C_{ox} * {W}/{L} * (V_{GS} - V_{th})^2
  where:  
  - mu_n = Electron mobility  
  - C_{ox} = Oxide capacitance per unit area  
  - W/L = Aspect ratio of MOSFET  
  - V_{GS} = Gate-to-source voltage  
  - V_{th} = Threshold voltage  

  The total **tail current** I_{tail} is split equally between the two transistors when inputs are equal.  
  
  I_D1 = I_D2 = I_{tail}/2
  The **output DC voltage** is given by:  
  V_{out1} = V_{DD} - I_{D1} R_D
  
  V_{out2} = V_{DD} - I_{D2} R_D
After designing the amplifier we get the following values:

**2. Transient Analysis (Time-Domain Response):**  
- In transient analysis, we apply a time-varying input signal and observe the response at the output.  
- The circuitâ€™s response to step, sinusoidal, or pulse inputs is analyzed.  
- This helps determine the amplifier's **rise time, fall time, and response to fast-changing signals.**

The below picture shows the waveforms obtained after transient analysis:

![Transient](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4c9334a-67fa-4690-a039-403fb2012ece)

Vin Max= VoutCM + Vth
Vin Max= 1.8 V + 0.36 V = 2.16 V

Similarly, Vin Min= Vgs + Vp
Vin Min= 1.02 V + 0.7 V = 1.72 V

When Vin Max is applied in the amplitude of the input sine wave we get the following output of a square wave

Similary for Vin Min, the output will be a square wave

**3. AC Analysis (Small-Signal Gain and Frequency Response):**  
- The small-signal model of the MOSFET is used for AC analysis.  
- The small-signal **differential gain** is given by:  
  A_d = g_m*R_D
  where g_m is the transconductance of the MOSFET  
  - Frequency response is determined by analyzing the **3dB bandwidth**.

We get the following frequency response for the given circuit
