**Theory:**  
A **MOSFET differential amplifier** is a fundamental circuit used in analog electronics, particularly in operational amplifiers, signal processing, and communication circuits. It amplifies the voltage difference between two input signals while suppressing common-mode signals.

**Circuit Description:**  
A MOSFET differential amplifier consists of:  
1. **Two matched MOSFETs (M1 and M2)** forming the differential pair.  
2. **A current source (or resistor) at the source terminal** to provide a stable tail current.  
3. **Drain resistors (RD1 and RD2)** to convert current variations into voltage output.  
4. **Supply voltage (V_DD)** to power the circuit.  
5. **Gate terminals receiving the differential inputs (\(V_{in1}\) and \(V_{in2}\)).**

**Types of Analysis:**

**1. DC Analysis (Biasing and Operating Point Calculation):**  
DC analysis helps determine the operating point (Q-point) of the MOSFETs.  
- Assume both transistors are in **saturation region**:  

  I_{D} = 1/2*mu_n*C_{ox}*{W}/{L}*(V_{GS} - V_{th})^2
  where:  
  - mu_n = Electron mobility  
  - C_{ox} = Oxide capacitance per unit area  
  - W/L = Aspect ratio of MOSFET  
  - V_{GS} = Gate-to-source voltage  
  - V_{th} = Threshold voltage  

  The total **tail current** I_{tail} is split equally between the two transistors when inputs are equal.  
  
  I_D1 = I_D2 = I_{tail}/2
  The **output DC voltage** is given by:  
  V_{out1} = V_{DD} - I_{D1} R_D
  V_{out2} = V_{DD} - I_{D2} R_D

**2. Transient Analysis (Time-Domain Response):**  
- In transient analysis, we apply a time-varying input signal and observe the response at the output.  
- The circuitâ€™s response to step, sinusoidal, or pulse inputs is analyzed.  
- This helps determine the amplifier's **rise time, fall time, and response to fast-changing signals.**  

**3. AC Analysis (Small-Signal Gain and Frequency Response):**  
- The small-signal model of the MOSFET is used for AC analysis.  
- The small-signal **differential gain** is given by:  
  A_d = g_m*R_D
  where g_m is the transconductance of the MOSFET  
  - Frequency response is determined by analyzing the **3dB bandwidth**, which depends on the **parasitic capacitances and load capacitance.**
